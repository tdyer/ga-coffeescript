   CoffeeScript book.

   this book.

    brew install node 
    brew upgrade node
    # v0.10.22 is my version
** Install npm Node Package Mananger (npm)
   npm install -g coffee-script
   # 1.3.14
** Check that coffeescript is installed
   coffee -v
   # CoffeeScript version 1.6.3

* Coffeescript usage:
   coffee --help
   or 
   http://coffeescript.org/ go to the Usage section

* Watch for changes to your coffeescript files and compile into 
   javascript.
   coffee --watch --compile script.coffee

* Lets write some coffeescript.
** For each of the below files:
*** Open up the coffeescript and javascript files side by side 
    in your editor.
*** Insert the javascript filename into the src attribute of the the 
    script tag in the index.html file. Open index.html in the browser
    and step though in the chrome debugger.

    brew install phantomjs
    And run each example below
    phantomjs <filename.coffee>
*** simple_function.coffee
*** array_objects.coffee
*** operator_aliases.coffee
